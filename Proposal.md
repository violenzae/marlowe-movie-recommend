# Name of Student: Rachel Schieferstein

# Name of Project: Marlowe

## Project’s Purpose or Goal: 

Chatbot interface that asks the user questions and uses their answers to select 5 movies for them.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

At least a branching logic based "fake" film noir themed detective chatbot that will query several APIs with information regarding genre and era and plot and return five movies (can be randomized from large pool at first).

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

React, node.js, DialogFlow, OMDB API for movie plot, year and genre querying and then utelly API to show where it is available for streaming in users country

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

I will use authentication and a database to save user preferences, answers and recommendations. 

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

NLP and maybe Dialog Flow (Natural language processing packages for node, for chat bot for stretch goal). NoSQL and Firebase authentication to save user's recommendation and preferences. Option to "add to list" and "not interested".

## Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?

If you know of any other resources for natural language programming tools or tutorials off of the top of your head that would be great.
